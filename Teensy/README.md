# Teensy
These are the files useful for development on the Teensy located in the Rigid Wing.

## Adding missing custom libraries
Add the folders `custom_libraries\Constants` and `custom_libraries\nanopb-lib` to wherever your Arduino installation looks for libraries. For me, this is `$(USER)\Documents\Arduino\libraries`. See http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries for more details.
